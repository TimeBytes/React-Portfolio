        Greetings! I'm Andy Zhong, a passionate web development enthusiast
        currently studying Web Development at University of Toronto Bootcamp. My
        journey in the world of programming began back in high school when I
        delved into the realms of Python and Java, sparking my fascination for
        the endless possibilities of computer programming. Although I briefly
        pursued Business Administration and Financial Planning during my college
        years, coding remained a constant calling in the back of my mind. After
        leaving my previous job, I finally decided to follow my heart and make
        coding a central part of my life once again by enrolling in this
        transformative web development bootcamp.

      <p className="container">
        Throughout this immersive experience, I'm relishing the opportunity to
        refine my skills in web development and dive deep into the realms of
        front-end and back-end technologies. The blend of creativity and logic
        that web development offers truly ignites my passion for
        problem-solving, allowing me to craft interactive and user-friendly
        websites and applications. As I combine my past experiences with the
        fresh knowledge I'm gaining, I'm excited to build a rewarding career
        that allows me to merge my business acumen with my programming
        expertise, all while contributing to the ever-evolving digital
        landscape. Beyond the bootcamp, I envision myself as an adaptable and
        innovative developer, continuously exploring emerging technologies,
        collaborating with diverse teams, and using coding as a powerful tool to
        bring ideas to life and create meaningful solutions for real-world
        challenges.
